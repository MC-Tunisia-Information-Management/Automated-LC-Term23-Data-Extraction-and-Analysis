# Automated-LC-Term23-Data-Extraction-and-Analysis
The lcsActual() function automates data extraction and analysis for AIESEC's Local Committee Support (LCS) operations, specifically for Term 23. It operates within Google Sheets, accessing the "Base actuals term 23_LC" sheet to retrieve a list of LCS entities (lcs) from a specific column. Using predefined start and end dates (sprintStartDate and sprintEndDate arrays), it constructs API URLs to query AIESEC's analytics API for performance metrics. The function iterates through each LCS entity, fetching detailed metrics such as applicant counts, match statistics, and completion rates. Retrieved data is formatted into arrays and written back into the spreadsheet, facilitating ongoing performance monitoring and reporting within AIESEC's operational framework.
